# MediCare Hospital Management System

## Introduction

The system is developed using a three-tier (3D) architecture, which is organized into User, Hospital and Data. The User package includes graphical user interfaces. That provides a high-level level user-friendly experience for users. The Hospital package contains object-oriented classes, including Administrator, Appointment, Bill, Doctor, Lab, MedicalRecord, MedicalStaff, Patient, Person, and Staff. The Data package is responsible for file handling. However, that provides benefits including faster development, improved scalability, reliability and security in the system 

## Application of Object-Oriented Programming

Java is used for Object-Oriented Programming. That style is closer to the real-world scenarios, such as a Hospital Management System (HMS). The structure contains objects, classes, methods and attributes. That consists of main principles such as Object, Class, Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism
