# MediCare Hospital Management System

## Introduction

The system is developed using a three-tier (3D) architecture, which is organized into User, Hospital and Data. The User package includes graphical user interfaces. That provides a high-level level user-friendly experience for users. The Hospital package contains object-oriented classes, including Administrator, Appointment, Bill, Doctor, Lab, MedicalRecord, MedicalStaff, Patient, Person, and Staff. The Data package is responsible for file handling. However, that provides benefits including faster development, improved scalability, reliability and security in the system 

## Application of Object-Oriented Programming

Java is used for Object-Oriented Programming. That style is closer to the real-world scenarios, such as a Hospital Management System (HMS). The structure contains objects, classes, methods and attributes. That consists of main principles such as Object, Class, Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism

### Object 

Objects have characteristics which are used to describe them. These characteristics are known as attributes. An attribute defines the current state of an object. 

### Class

Classes can be described as a blueprint for an object.

### Abstraction

Data abstraction provides an essential feature to the outside without including implementation details. For example, abstraction is used in the Person abstract class. 

### Inheritance

Inheritance is the process that is used to gain properties (variables and methods) from one class to another. It provides to manage information in hierarchical order. The class inheriting the properties of another is the subclass, and the class whose properties are inherited is the superclass.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to wrapping data and methods into a class. The variables of one class will be hidden from the other classes and accessible only through the methods of the current class. That is called data hiding. To achieve encapsulation in this project, declare the class’s variable as private and provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variable’s values. 

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to the idea of having many forms. This project uses method overriding and overloading. 

## Conclusion

The document successfully represented the expected tasks, including the principle of Object-Oriented Programming concept (OOP), main functionalities of the system with proper explanation, a user-friendly manual and a test document.
The MediCare Hospital Management System (HMS) distributed various functions for users, such as maintaining medical records, keeping lab test records, scheduling appointments and generating bills, creating patient profiles, registering doctors and medical staff and much more. All the functions are involved with user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with proper file and exception handling.
The user manual navigates the user without system crashes. That includes system screenshots and screen capture videos to enhance the user experience. 
The developer tested the system using unit testing and integration testing methods. The recommendation of the system will be applied in the near future by learning new technical skills such as Spring Boot, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and REST APIs, etc.  Then, the system will be implemented into a web application with more functionalities to deliver a better experience for users. That will allow users to access from any location.  
In conclusion, the MediCare project achieves an error-free, effective, user-friendly GUI application using the Java programming language. This will support hospital management efficiency, reliability, and productivity. The user feedbacks were encouraged to contribute more effort to the projects. This software project is a strong foundation for the developer to enhance knowledge and skills.
